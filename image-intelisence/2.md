# Image Intellisense

## Problem
1. In the digital age, we accumulate a vast number of images, which often become difficult to manage and locate within this extensive visual library.
2. The desire is to implement a system that allows us to search for images using text-based queries, eliminating the need for the laborious task of individually tagging each image.
3. A key requirement of this system is the ability to retrieve images swiftly, ensuring a seamless user experience.
4. Importantly, this system must be scalable, capable of handling and efficiently managing a database of millions of images.

## Tech comes to the rescue
1. CLIP, an innovative model developed by OpenAI, revolutionizes the way we handle images and text by integrating them into a unified embedding space.
2. This groundbreaking technology serves as a cornerstone in the advent of the image generation era, paving the way for unprecedented advancements in the field.

## Implimentation
1. The fundamental architecture of our system is built around an image processing pipeline. Upon the introduction of an image, the system initiates a two-step process. Firstly, the image is uploaded to a designated storage. Subsequently, a pipeline is triggered which navigates the image through the CLIP model, generating an embedding that is then stored in a vector database.
2. When a text-based query is submitted, the system embeds the text and performs a vector similarity search across the database. This process identifies and retrieves the images that are most relevant to the query.
3. Finally, the selected images are returned to the user, providing a seamless and efficient image retrieval experience.

## High Level Design
1. The Image Upload Service:
- This is a sophisticated server designed to accept an image, store it on a disk, and subsequently return the URL of the image.
2. The Embedding Pipeline:
- This is a dedicated server that accepts the image URL and utilizes the CLIP model to create an embedding.
- The generated embedding is then stored in a vector database for future reference.
- Given the resource-intensive nature of the embedding creation process, it is designed to run in the background, facilitated by a message queue system.
3. The Search Service:
- This service accepts a text-based query and processes it through the CLIP model to generate a corresponding embedding.
- It then performs a vector similarity search using the generated embedding across the database, returning the images that are most relevant to the query.
4. The User Interface:
- A highly functional frontend has been developed to facilitate the uploading and searching of images, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

## Tech Stack
1. Our frontend will be constructed utilizing the fundamental building blocks of the web, HTML and JavaScript, in their purest form, often referred to as 'vanilla'.
2. To ensure a secure and efficient communication between our services, a gateway service is indispensable. This service will act as a proxy, channeling all incoming requests to their appropriate destinations.
3. The technology of choice for our gateway service is NodeJS, coupled with the Express framework, renowned for its speed and minimalist structure.
4. The task of vectorization, a crucial step in our image and text processing pipeline, will be handled by a dedicated FastAPI application. This application will be responsible for transforming both images and text queries into their vector representations.
5. The image upload service will be powered by a FastAPI server. This server will accept images in base64 format and return a URL pointing to the stored image.
6. The retrieval of images from storage will be managed by a server implemented in Go. This server will fetch the requested image from disk and return it to the requesting entity.
7. To manage the potentially high volume of tasks and ensure smooth operation of our system, we will employ Redis as our queueing system. Redis is particularly suited to our needs due to its performance and versatility.
8. The vector database, a key component in our system, will be powered by Qdrant. Qdrant is a highly regarded solution in the field, known for its speed and robustness, largely attributed to its internal implementation in Rust.
9. User Database: The metadata of the images as well as the user data is stored in Postgres which is the industry standard for SQL based databases.
